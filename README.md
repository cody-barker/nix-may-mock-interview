## INTERVIEW RETROSPECTIVE

Nix conducted a mock technical interview with me on 10/26/23, just as she would for her company Olo, as if we had we never met.

Nix gave me full marks for virtually all aspects of the interview.
<br>
She commended me on:
<br>
-rephrasing the deliverables and asking clarifying questions
<br>
-keeping my cool when I made mistakes
<br>
-solving the initial deliverable without the use of ChatGPT
<br>
-being able to utilize ChatGPT to quickly and effectively solve the bonus deliverables
<br>
-being able to communicate clearly and in plain english with the project manager
<br>
-taking a stab at the harder, unfamiliar logic before resorting to ChatGPT
<br>
-speaking to the new technologies I would use to prepare Trakable for production, like Role Models and more joins tables
<br>
-discussing more complex libraries and terms that most junior's do not, like bcrypt, SPA, and others
<br>
-having deployed my projects and created their backends
<br>
<br>
Typically, a junior engineer would only be expected to solve the first deliverable, but I solved all of them!
<br>
Nix did suggest I use 3 edge cases when testing my methods
<br>
She also suggested that ChatGPT might not be as reliable when dealing with larger codebases/complex file/function structure
<br>
Regardless, she said she would absolutely hire me as a junior engineer and said I did exceptionally well!
