##INTERVIEW RETROSPECTIVE

#Nix conducted a mock technical interview with me on 10/26/23, just as she would for her company Olo, as if we had we never met.

# Nix gave me full marks for virtually all aspects of the interview
# She commended me on:
# -rephrasing the deliverables and asking clarifying questions
# -keeping my cool when I made mistakes
# -solving the initial deliverable without the use of ChatGPT
# -being able to utilize ChatGPT to quickly and effectively solve the bonus deliverables
# -being able to communicate clearly and in plain english with the project manager
# -taking a stab at the harder, unfamiliar logic before resorting to ChatGPT
# -speaking to the new technologies I would use to prepare Trakable for production, like Role Models and more joins tables
# -discussing more complex libraries and terms that most junior's do not, like bcrypt, SPA, and others
# -having deployed my projects and created their backends

# Typically, a junior engineer would only be expected to solve the first deliverable, but I solved all of them!
# Nix did suggest I use 3 edge cases when testing my methods
# She also suggested that ChatGPT might not be as reliable when dealing with larger codebases/complex file/function structure
# Regardless, she said she would absolutely hire me as a junior engineer and said I did exceptionally well!
